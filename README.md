# Neural-Style-Transfer-using-pytorch
 
Neural Style transfer is an optimization used to take two images **content image** and **style image**. Both the images blended, a new image is obtained(mixture of both the images). This paper was done by **Leon A.Gatys**, **Matthias Bethge** and **Alexander S Ecker**.

In this repository I have given the **pytorch** code for Neural Style Transfer.
